    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      Swimming has been practiced as early as 2500 BC in Egypt, Assyrian, Greek, and Roman civilizations.<br>
      In Greece and Rome, swimming was part of martial training and part of the education system for males.
       In Japan, there is evidence of swimming races during the 1 st century BC and by the 17 th century, swimming was made compulsory in schools.<br> 
      Archaeological and other evidence shows swimming to have been practiced as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt and thereafter in Assyrian, Greek, and Roman civilizations.
      In Greece and Rome swimming was a part of martial training and was, with the alphabet, also part of elementary education for males.
      In the Orient swimming dates back at least to the 1st century BCE, there being some evidence of swimming races then in Japan.
      By the 17th century an imperial edict had made the teaching of swimming compulsory in the schools.
      Organized swimming events were held in the 19th century before Japan was opened to the Western world.
      Among the preliterate maritime peoples of the Pacific, swimming was evidently learned by children about the time they walked, or even before.
      Among the ancient Greeks there is note of occasional races, and a famous boxer swam as part of his training.
      The Romans built swimming pools, distinct from their baths. In the 1st century BCE the Roman Gaius Maecenas is said to have built the first heated swimming pool.

      The lack of swimming in Europe during the Middle Ages is explained by some authorities as having been caused by a fear that swimming spread infection
      and caused epidemics. There is some evidence of swimming at seashore resorts of Great Britain in the late 17th century, evidently in conjunction with water therapy.
      Not until the 19th century, however, did the popularity of swimming as both recreation and sport begin in earnest.
      When the first swimming organization was formed there in 1837, London had six indoor pools with diving boards.
      The first swimming championship was a 440-yard (400-metre) race, held in Australia in 1846 and annually thereafter.
      The Metropolitan Swimming Clubs of London, founded in 1869, ultimately became the Amateur Swimming Association, the governing body of British amateur swimming.
      National swimming federations were formed in several European countries from 1882 to 1889.
      In the United States swimming was first nationally organized as a sport by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on its founding in 1888.
      The Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) was founded in 1909.
