        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why people swim, from swimming as a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity.
          Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries.
        </p>

          <h3>Recreation</h3>
          <p class="content">
            Many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to take part in.
            Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation or rehabilitation.
            The support of the water, and the reduction in impact, make swimming accessible for people who are unable to undertake activities such as running.
          </p>
          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p class="content">
            Swimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles,
            except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles.
            As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. Swimming is also effective in improving health for people
            with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to positively impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers.
            Swimming can even improve mood.
          </p>
          <h3>Elderly swimmers</h3>
          <p class="content">
            Swimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, mainly because it presents little risk of injury and is also low impact. Exercise in the water
            works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors.
          </p>
          <h3>Sport</h3>
          <p class="content">
            Swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time. Competitors
            swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes
            events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley. During the season competitive swimmers typically train several times a week,
            this is in order to preserve fitness as well as promoting overload in training. Furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage
            called taper where intensity is reduce in preparation for racing, during taper power and feel in the water are concentrated.<br>
            The sport is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 meters in length.
            In the United States, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition.
            Other swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern
            pentathlon.

          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p class="content">
            As a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning. Drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from
            swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water. From 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the United States,
            approximating 10 deaths a day.<br>
            To minimize the risk and prevent potential drownings from occurring, lifeguards are often employed to supervise swimming locations such as pools and beaches.
            Different lifeguards receive different training depending on the sites that they are employed at; i.e. a waterfront lifeguard receives more rigorous training
            than a poolside lifeguard. Well-known aquatic training services include the National Lifesaving Society and the Canadian Red Cross, which specialize in training
            lifeguards in North America.
